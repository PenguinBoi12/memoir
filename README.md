# memoir
Memoir brings effortless, flexible caching to Elixir. Inspired by the elegance of Rails, it lets you cache results with clean macros or decorators, no boilerplate, no fuss. Use ETS, Cachex, or any backend you like with a plug-and-play adapter system. Write expressive, maintainable caching logic that just works.
